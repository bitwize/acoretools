#+TITLE: Ada Core Unix Tools
#+AUTHOR: bitwize@gmail.com

These are clones of basic Unix utilities (~ls~, ~cat~, etc.) written
in Ada.

This repository is more of an experiment in learning programming in
Ada, and safer software design, than anything else. Feel free to use
and study at your leisure.
