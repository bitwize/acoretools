#+TITLE: Ada Core Unix Tools
#+AUTHOR: bitwize@gmail.com

* Intro

These are clones of basic Unix utilities (~ls~, ~cat~, etc.) written
in Ada.

This repository is more of an experiment in learning programming in
Ada, and safer software design, than anything else. Feel free to use
and study at your leisure.

* Building

Everything is done with gprbuild. I haven't made this an Alire package
yet, so you're going to have to satisfy the dependency yourself.

Check out a copy of Florist (POSIX bindings for Ada) into a directory
at the same level as this one. So from this tree's root, say:

: git clone https://github.com/adacore/florist.git ../florist

Then build that in place (make sure you have Make installed):

: cd ../florist
: ./configure ; make

Then from this directory say:

: gprbuild ls.gpr
: gprbuild cat.gpr


You can also build a test runner for the common switch library with:

: gprbuild test_switches.gpr

The executable will end up in ~/build/<name of program>/~ or
~/build/tests/~ for test runners.
